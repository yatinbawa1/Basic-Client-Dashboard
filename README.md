# Basic Client Dashboard

## [_Hosted Link_](https://basic-client-dashboard-git-main-yatinbawa1s-projects.vercel.app?_vercel_share=QQeussKvocYmzVPWPm4UV45GrX8H1XIN)

### Basic Setup

I have used the following libraries

1. React
2. Tailwind
3. Axios
4. Material UI Icons (Downloading each png/svg is a hassle)

To run the app on your system.

1. Run npm install
2. Run npm dev

### My Approch and Assumptions

My approch was to have a setup that closely follows real-world development. Making the app as similar to the design philosophy of WellnessZ while keeping in mind the time and library constraints.

### What I would improve

1. Improve design, the current design follows material ui guidelines but still looks a bit outdated.
2. run some unit tests.
3. Use redux or some other state management library to better manage user data

### Features

- [x] Search and Filter (Only Search Implemented)
- [x] Skeleton Loader
- [x] Pagination
- [x] Form to add a mock user
